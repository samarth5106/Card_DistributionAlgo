Card Distribution Algorithm
This is a C program that simulates the distribution of 52 playing cards among a group of players. The program allows users to determine:

Which player receives the last card
Which player receives a specific card (Nth card)

Features
1)Supports multiple players
 (minimum 2).
2)Allows the user to select the starting point of card distribution:
   a)The distributor
   b)The player next to the distributor
3)Provides an option to continue checking multiple cases.

How It Works
1)The user enters the number of players.
2)They select one of two options:
   a)Finding the player who receives the last card.
   b)Finding the player who receives a specific card (Nth card).
3)The user specifies the distributor and starting position.
4)The program calculates and displays the result.

Example of Output:
Enter the number of players: 4

1. Finding player number getting last card
2. Finding which player received Nth card
   
Enter the choice: 1

Distribution of cards started from:
1. Distributor
2. Player next to distributor

Enter 1 or 2: 1

Enter the player number who distributed cards: 2

The last card will be received by player 1
